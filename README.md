# autonomous_mobile_robot
This project, completed as for my Project-Based MEng in Robotics and Control, focuses on developing and evaluating an autonomous mobile robot navigation system for warehouse environments. The goal was to design a robot capable of mapping, localization, path planning, and obstacle avoidance in a dynamic and cluttered environment, which is a core challenge in modern warehouse automation.



Using ROS2 and Gazebo, I built a custom robot model equipped with sensors (LiDAR, IMU, wheel encoders) and tested it in a warehouse simulation. The system integrates advanced robotics algorithms for SLAM, localization, sensor fusion, and path planning with obstacle avoidance, while analyzing performance under varying real-world challenges such as sensor noise, odometry errors, and moving obstacles. This allowed me to evaluate the robustness of my autonomous navigation system in conditions that closely resemble those faced by autonomous mobile robots in real warehouses.
